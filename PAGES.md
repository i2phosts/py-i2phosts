How to create/customize custom pages
====================================

Previously pages like /contacts/ and /faq/ was just a templates. To change its content service operator was supposed to
edit templates directly. This is not a convenient way so it was changed.

Now, to have a page like /contacts/ be filled, you need to create/edit it via django admin interface (/admin/pages/).
Note that you should use markdown syntax here.
